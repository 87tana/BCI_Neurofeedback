In the field of motor imagery neurofeedback (MI-NF) and motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), studies have consistently reported inter-individual performance variability. 
Investigation of these variabilities has led to the proposition that stable anatomical differences that persist across the lifespan may have predictive value for understanding performance variability in MI-NF and MI-BCI (Grosse et al., 2013). 
Electroencephalography (EEG), with its affordability and high temporal resolution, has been the preferred modality for such investigations, often relying on event-related desynchronization (ERD) as the neural signature. ERD, which represents an amplitude reduction in sensorimotor rhythms during motor activity in the [8-30] Hertz frequency range, is particularly pronounced over contralateral sensorimotor areas during unilateral movement execution. 
Despite the advantages of EEG, it is imperative to mitigate the effects of volume conduction by spatial filtering. 
Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) stand out as one of the most effective spatial filtering methods, generating subject-specific spatial filters through EEG signal decomposition.
The selection of CSP filters taking into account inter-individual specificities is considered crucial for improving rehabilitation outcomes. 
However, the current landscape lacks a systematic approach for filter selection, often relying on empirical methods or heuristic guidelines, as illustrated by plausible and implausible CSPs according to the Niclas Braun's guidelines used in this study.

## Aim of Study
The **hypothesis** is that anatomical variabilities can help explain the variability of scalp-level EEG patterns and CSP patterns.
Therefore, the **aim of this study** is to investigate the correlations between inter-individual anatomical variabilities and scalp-level EEG patterns in order to evaluate two CSP selection approaches that take anatomical information into account. 
In particular, two anatomical variabilities were considered: 
- the morphological variability of the hand knob (HK), a key area in the motor cortex,
- the percentage of cortical activity during hand motor execution in the gyrus. 

The HK, located anterior to the central sulcus, exhibits a knob-like structure that varies across hemispheres and subjects, as illustrated by five variants: Omega, M-Epsilon, Epsilon, L-Epsilon, and Null. The study also explores the plausibility of the selected CSPs based on anatomical information.

## Dataset

This study involves the re-analysis of a separately recorded EEGâ€”(f)MRI dataset comprising 20 healthy older adults ranging in age from 48 to 77 years, with a mean age of 61.4 years (Meekes et al., 2017).

The dataset focuses on the task of hand motor execution, specifically closing and opening actions in a pseudo-random order, with 20 trials:
- Rest: 5-9 s 
- Cue: 3 s 
- Execution: 5 s

## Methodology
The study steps are as follows:
1. Define the region of interest (ROI) for each subject based on individual functional information. 
2. Simulate the cortical activity associated with hand motor execution to obtain EEG patterns at the scalp using forward modeling.
3. Use the simulated pattern for each individual to select a CSP pattern. 

### Define ROI based on fMRI data

In this study, due to uncertainty regarding the precise boundaries of hand motor activity in the cortex, individual BOLD signals from fMRI data are used to define the ROI. Cortical areas are extracted individually from the MRI data. 
A first-level analysis is then performed to identify significantly activated vertices on each subject's cortical surface. 
The most activated vertices within the primary motor cortex (M1) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are then selected as the ROI for each subject.

### Simulate EEG patterns

In this step, the EEG voltage distributions were simulated at the scalp level. The EEG electrodes and cortical surfaces were co-registered. 
A forward model was then computed using the symmetric boundary element method (BEM) to estimate volume conduction, and the source was modeled using the minimum norm estimation method. 
The results included head and source models. The ROI was then seeded with a uniform signal, and the head and source models were used to simulate scalp-level EEG patterns.

### CSP selection approaches

In this study, two different approaches to CSP pattern selection are explored, namely BCOR and BQS.

#### BCOR
In BCOR, the correlation (COR) between the simulated pattern and all available CSP patterns is calculated for each subject. 
The CSP with the highest correlation value is then selected, based on the assumption that it is the most anatomically plausible for the subject.

#### BQS
In BQS, CSPs with significant correlations to the simulated patterns and substantial ERD are sought by maximizing the Quadratic Score (QS), where QS is the product of COR and ERD, scaled between 0 and 1. 
For each ERD component (ERD<sub>i</sub>), a bandpass filter was applied to the EEG signal, followed by epochs from 0.5 to 5 seconds after the onset of execution and 7.5 to 3 seconds before the onset of rest. 
After artifact rejection and application of CSP<sub>i</sub>, ERD was calculated using a formula based on signal power. The result was averaged over time, epochs, and channels to obtain a scalar value.

**Example:** CSP3 showed the highest correlation with the simulated pattern, albeit with a small ERD. 
Conversely, CSP1 had the largest ERD, but with a small COR. Notably, CSP2 had the highest QS, with both a significant COR and ERD.

## Results
In this section, the selected CSP patterns are assessed for meaningful relationships to anatomical variability.
Means and standard deviations (SD) are calculated to summarize the resulting patterns. The figures show substantial correlations between the simulated patterns for both hemispheres. 
The mean simulated pattern is centered on the sensorimotor area, with the SD deviating only slightly from the mean. 
As for the selected CSPs based on both approaches, they generally represent hand motor activity, with means concentrated in the sensorimotor area. 
However, the SD values show that the patterns are distributed throughout the head, with significant deviations from the mean for different subjects.

### Influence of hand knob variants
To assess whether anatomical differences in HK could lead to different surface patterns, the correlation between simulated patterns is calculated to measure differences and similarities between individuals. 
This served as a distance measure between individuals. Due to insufficient samples of all the knob variants, subjects are divided into two groups: one with Omega and one with other knob variants.

</p>

Differences in correlations between subjects with Omega variants and those with other variants were analyzed using a two-sample t-test. 
The results, shown in the table, indicate that only the selected CSPs based on BCOR in the right hemisphere of subjects with Omega variants are significantly different from those with other knob variants. 
However, the overall surface patterns are almost identical between individuals, suggesting a negligible role of the hand knob in this study.

## Influence of gyral activity

To assess the role of gyral activity, subjects are ordered by the percentage of their ROIs that lay in the gyrus. 
The resulting plot shows a monotonically decreasing pattern with no inflection point, which prevented the subjects from being grouped for a t-test.

</p>

To examine gyrus activity in more detail, each pair of subjects is plotted against two features: their correlation score and the difference between their gyrus activities. 
The plot shows no linear relationship between the subjects' correlations and their gyral activities, meaning that there is no meaningful relationship between gyral activity and the subjects' simulated patterns and CSPs.

## Relationship between COR, ERD, and plausibility
To better understand the relationship between COR, ERD, and plausibility, the selected CSPs are sorted by their COR values and their plausibility is examined based on the Niclas guidelines. In the figure, the red curve represents the COR values and the blue curve represents the ERD values. Typically, the first CSPs are more plausible for both criteria, although there are exceptions. For example, C08 has the best correlation but seems less plausible than C13. A comparison of COR and ERD shows that in many cases a large COR value coincides with a large ERD, but this correlation is not consistent. Impractical CSPs often have small ERDs, but the reverse is not necessarily true, suggesting that COR and ERD may have different importance in CSP selection for different subjects.
